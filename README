NAME
    HTML::InfoVis - Content generators for the InfoVis Javascript toolkit

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::InfoVis is an experimental set of packages that provide a Perl API
    to the JavaScript InfoVis tree/graph rendering library.

    More information can be found at <http://thejit.org/>.

    In this initial implementation, the only available class is
    HTML::InfoVis::Graph, which assists in generation InfoVis-compatible
    JSON graph dumps.
